            TEAM FORMATION
         </h3>
         <p>
            Teams must be formed prior to the event with a maximum of 5 members and should include students with a range
            of skills, such as programming, design, and research. <br><br>Teams should be made up exclusively of CIS
            students who are not event organizers, facilitators, judges, sponsors, or in any other privileged position
            at the event.

         </p>

         <h3 class="guide-title">
            EQUIPMENT
         </h3>
         <p>
            Since the development and coding will be done remotely, participants will be using their own devices ensuring
            that they have all the necessary software and tools
            installed to develop their project. <br><br>
            Participants are required to bring at least one laptop per team for the wireframing and project presentation onsite.<br><br>
            Participants who plan to utilize online resources will need to bring their own internet connection, while those who don't have internet access can use offline resources
            instead.
         </p>

         <h3 class="guide-title">
            TIMEFRAME
         </h3>
         <p>
            Due to time constraints, the coding timeframe is strictly limited to overnight. This restriction encourages participants to work efficiently and creatively within a limited timeframe, which can be a valuable learning experience.<br><br>
            The coding timeframe for a hackathon starts at 3 PM and ends at 6 AM the next day, the total duration of the coding timeframe would be approximately 15 hours.
         </p>

            PROJECT GUIDELINES
         </h3>
         <p>
            Teams can use libraries and frameworks in their projects. <br><br>Participants can use templates with only basic UI elements. They are allowed to use pre-made
            templates, but is not allowed to use any pre-existing functionalities or complex UI components.<br><br>The
            main goal should be to modify the templates to create something unique and creative. Participants can add
            new features, modify existing ones, and change the overall design of the template.<br><br>Teams are required to stop hacking once the designated time is up and must be present at the event venue at the exact time. However, they are permitted to debug and make minor fixes to their programs after the allotted time. For example, if a team discovers a bug during their hack demonstration that breaks their application, they may make a few lines of code changes to fix the issue. However, significant modifications or the addition of new features are prohibited.<br><br>All
            intellectual property rights to the projects developed during the hackathon will remain with the
            participating team.

            PROGRAM FLOW
         </h3>
         <p>
            <span>
               Day before the event: Briefing with the teams for preparation for the upcoming competition</span><br>
            Participants will be provided with details of a particular business problem and will need to concentrate on
            creating a solution. The organizers will offer recommendations on the suggested solutions or systems that
            could be developed.<br><br>

            <span>Day 1 (Morning) – Pitch Presentation</span><br>
            There would be a pitching session for topics, during which the participants will be introduced. Each team
            will present their proposed solution to the business problem that was discussed during the briefing. Due to
            time constraints, the ideation, research, and brainstorming of each team will be done the day before the
            competition.<br><br>

            <span>Day 1 (Afternoon) – Wireframes Presentation</span><br>
            After the pitching presentation, participants will need to create wireframes within a limited time. Each
            team will then present their wireframes and initial designs to the judges.<br><br>

            <span>Development and Coding</span><br>
            To accommodate time constraints and facility/resource limitations, the participants will work on their
            projects remotely. This approach creates a more inclusive and accessible environment that fosters innovation
            and collaboration, as participants can work on their projects at a time and location that suits them best.
            Allowing remote work is a practical solution that ensures the success of the hackathon while providing
            participants with an optimal experience.<br><br>

            <span>Day 2 – Final Demo and Presentation</span><br>
            The Hackathon Final Round is the culminating event of the competition, where each team will present their
            completed web-based app to a panel of judges and an audience. This final demo and presentation will showcase
            the system that they have created throughout the hackathon.<br>During the final round, each team will have a
            set amount of time to demonstrate the functionality and features of their web-based app. They may show how
            users can interact with the app, highlight the app's key features and functionalities, and explain the
            benefits and value of their app to the audience and judges.<br>Teams will also need to be prepared to answer
            questions from the judges and audience about their app, including the technical aspects of the development
            process, the user experience, and the overall concept and design of the app.<br>The judges will evaluate
            each team based on various criteria, such as the app's functionality, usability, innovation, and overall
            impact. The winning team will be announced at the end of the final round, and may receive prizes,
            recognition, and opportunities for further development of their app.<br>The goal of the Hackathon Final
            Round is to showcase the impressive work of each team, and to determine the winning team based on their
            creativity, technical skills, and ability to deliver a functional and innovative web-based app.
